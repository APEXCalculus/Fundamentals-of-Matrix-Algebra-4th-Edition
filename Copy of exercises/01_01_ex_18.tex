{A jar contains 100 marbles. We know there are twice as many green marbles as red; that the number of blue and yellow marbles is the same as the number of green; and that three times the number of yellow balls together with the red balls gives the same numbers as the blue balls. How many of each color balls are in the jar?}
{35 blue, 40 green, 20 red, 5 yellow}
